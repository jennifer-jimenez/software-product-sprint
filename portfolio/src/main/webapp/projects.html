    <h2>Schedule Pro</h2>
    <p>
      Schedule Pro is a web app that takes a userâ€™s weekly non-negotiable scheduled tasks (e.g. class, work) as 
      well as tasks that can be completed any time (e.g. going to the store) and optimizes their route based on 
      distance. Distance is calculated using data from Google Maps Distance Matrix API. The web app was created 
      using the Flask microframework (incorporates Python, HTML/CSS, Jinja, and SQL).
