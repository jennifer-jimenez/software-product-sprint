    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Jennifer and I am rising junior at Yale University studying computer science. I am a proud 
        member of Trumbull College at Yale. On campus, I am involved with the Yale Undergraduate Prison Project as 
        a GED tutor for justice-impacted individuals. My main programming language is C, but I have also worked with 
        Python, SQL, and a little JavaScript. I have worked with HTML/CSS for a while, both on their own and within 
        the React framework. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I am originally from San Bernardino, California, which is where I am currently located. I love spending time
        outdoors, whether just in my own yard, a nearby park, or some other nearby attraction. Being located in the Inland 
        Empire means I have mountains, the beach, and the desert all within my reach, which I am very grateful for!
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I like to go on walks, do yoga, rewatch my favorite shows, and listen to music. I also
        like to paint (I'm bad at it) and play guitar, though I don't do it as much as I would like to. During quarantine
        I got into skateboarding a little bit and I would like to continue during the summer. :)
      </p>
